# Virtual Assistant aka "Mini Minh" :)

My parents have always told me that I should make friends, and I took it literally this time by "making a friend" and building my version of a Virtual Assistant.

For this project, I used:
- HTML and CSS for the UI.
- JavaScript to handle all of the logic, from handling the user's requests, finding the correct replies to answer the user, and communicating with the server.
- Web Speech API to incorporate voice data into this web app, using both SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech) and SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition).
- Node.js & MongoDB to handle the server and database.
- Puppeteer.js to automatically search for answers based on the user's questions and to play music in the background.
- Nodemailer.js to send email to the user's email address
- OpenWeather API to get the local temperature.

What I like the most about this project is that it could be as big as I want it to be since there's always more room to make the assistant more intelligent. Also, it gave me a better understanding of JavaScript and MongoDB before moving on and learning more advanced technologies like TypeScript and Firebase.
